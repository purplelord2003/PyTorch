# PyTorch Bootcamp

### This repository contains all my work throughout a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-for-deep-learning/?kw=pytorch&src=sac) on PyTorch offered by Daniel Bourke. 

You can find all the Google Colab notebooks that I have made along the way as well as the files I used to create 2 demo machine learning applications (FoodVision Mini and FoodVision Huge).

### FoodVision Mini
FoodVision Mini is a simple image classification application that classifies any image into 3 food categories: pizza, steak and sushi.\
The implementation can be found in "09_pytorch.ipynb".\
The application demo can be accessed via Hugging Face spaces [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/purplelord2003/foodvision_mini).

### FoodVision Huge
FoodVision Huge is a marked up version of FoodVision Mini which now classifies any image into 101 different food categories.
The implementation can be found in "09_pytorch.ipynb".\
The application demo can be accessed via Hugging Face spaces [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/purplelord2003/foodvision_big).
